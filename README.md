In addition, If Redis is not available, there are several alternative solutions that can be used for distributed caching:

1. Memcached:
   Memcached is a high-performance distributed memory object caching system for speeding up dynamic web applications by reducing database load. It supports simple key-value pair storage but does not support complex data structures like Redis. Memcached is well-suited for caching data that is frequently read but infrequently modified.

2. Couchbase:
   Couchbase is a NoSQL database but is also often used as a distributed cache system. Couchbase supports rich data models (including JSON documents), provides scalability, high availability, and data persistence. Couchbase is particularly suitable for applications requiring high performance, low latency, and high throughput.

3. Hazelcast:
   Hazelcast is an open-source Java distributed in-memory data grid that provides distributed caching, distributed queues, distributed locks, and more. Hazelcast can be seamlessly integrated into Java applications and supports various caching policies and data structures.

4. Apache Ignite:
   Apache Ignite is a high-performance distributed in-memory computing platform that provides distributed caching, real-time data stream processing, and large-scale data processing. Ignite supports multiple programming languages, including Java, C++, .NET, and more, and can be integrated with big data frameworks such as Hadoop and Spark.

5. Custom Distributed Cache Implementation:
   If you have specific requirements or want to have full control over the cache implementation, you may consider implementing a custom distributed cache system. This usually involves using a distributed storage system (such as HDFS, Ceph, etc.) and message queues (such as Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.) to manage the storage and access of cached data. However, this approach requires more development and maintenance efforts.

6. Cloud Provider's Cache Solutions:
   Many cloud service providers (such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, etc.) offer cloud-based distributed cache solutions. These solutions are usually easy to integrate and manage and can be scaled according to your needs.
